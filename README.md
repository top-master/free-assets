
## What?

This package proofs that these assets are free and ours.

## Why?

Because no other free asset(s) would look understandable in `16x16` resoulotion,
we made icons like the [`bug.png`](images/bug.png) file, pixel by pixel,
almost 100% manually by hand.

Said "manually by hand" is hard, and is worth it's own repository at least,
if not an entire patent.
